"""v0.26.0 slice A: host ``message_uid`` SHADOW bindings (design REVISION 3). After #436 decides an ingest,
each uid-bearing host dict gets one R3-3 class and the row #436 chose goes to the droppable ``host_uid_bindings``
table. Nothing feeds back into ingest, replay, emission or commit; every exception is caught, counted and fails
open. Event counter keys are ``[replay.]class.outcome[.reason]``; ``skipped.no_uid`` stays in memory, so a no-uid
host writes nothing. The shadow GATE is counted per binding in the table (``first_check`` / ``disagree_seen``),
so a replayed prefix never inflates it. ``LCM_HOST_MESSAGE_UID=off`` does nothing; ``on`` runs as ``shadow``.
From the first release, a persisted lineage key is ``<home_tag>:<root>`` (#836): one database shared by several
Hermes homes never mixes two profiles' roots of the same session id."""
