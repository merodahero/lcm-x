"""#582 survival fit: a compaction that cannot bring the list under the model window never costs the session.

When compress() is about to return a list that is still over the window (a publication failure, a sweep
deadline, a no-op, a lock after commit, an exception), the list is fitted on the way out:
- budget = effective window x (1 - LCM_SURVIVAL_RESERVE) minus the host's observed-minus-counted overhead;
- the FINAL list is measured with the host's own request estimator (and LCM's count, whichever is larger)
  and the oldest whole user turns are dropped until it fits; a cut falls only on a user row, so no
  tool result is orphaned;
- when the newest user turn alone is over budget, its largest stored rows are projected (tool outputs
  first): head/tail of the stored text around a mark naming the store id and the projection parameters,
  tool-call arguments over the head size replaced by the mark. A projection is a pure function of the
  stored row and its mark, so a re-ingest (same process or cold resume) recomputes it from that row and
  recognises the copy only on an exact match: it is never stored again, and no new message can take an
  old row's identity unless byte-identical to its projection. The raw rows stay in the store;
- a row that is not durably stored is never omitted (a row the ingest cursor cannot prove stored counts
  as durable only when it is DAG-verified LCM scaffold), and the list is never empty (#91).
- LCM's summary prefix (scaffold or verified carrier rows right after the system slot) stays whenever whole
  oldest turns can leave instead and the final list fits; otherwise the old rule applies and a WARNING says
  so (#650).
It writes no message, node or lifecycle row: only the metadata counter /lcm doctor reads. The global
assembly cap is never set (that would force overflow and trim every good compaction). The notice goes in
the system-prefix slot when the list has one, never as a conversation row; the one-shot user warning goes
through the host's automatic-compaction status hook. LCM_SURVIVAL_FIT=false turns it off.
