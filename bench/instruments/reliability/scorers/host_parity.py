"""D-A host-parity licence for B1/B2 (DESIGN-436-logical-identity.md REVISION 2, principle P-HOST).

LCM's lossless contract is fidelity to the host's durable conversation, so a stored user-row surplus of key k in
lineage L is licensed only up to what the host's own state.db holds in L:
licensed = min(surplus, host_count_L(k) - expected_L(k)), floored at 0 (multiset.licence). Deficits, assistant rows
and tool rows are never licensed. B2 keys host rows exactly as it keys stored rows (multiset.h: the edge strip only);
B1 counts ``[Tnn] user turn`` tags in the same host occurrences.

host_count counts what one host view holds, never physical copies. Hermes re-issues every durable row on every
rotation copy (a child session) and in-place generation (the old rows go inactive), H1 even with a fresh timestamp
per generation (436-host-identity-map.md), so neither rows across sessions nor distinct timestamps add up. A key's
count is the largest number of ACTIVE rows one session of the lineage holds at once (a durable double persist: H2
rows 105/106, PROBE.md group 1), and 1 when the lineage holds it only on inactive rows (a compacted generation).
A key whose content begins with one of the scored plugin tree's own generated-carrier markers
(plugin_tree.carrier_markers) is never licensed, nor counted toward a B1 tag. Recovery prefixes anywhere in a
merged row also exclude it: LCM's carriers are LCM's responsibility
(R8 / D-D), so a host echo of one licenses nothing. Fails closed: a missing or unreadable state.db, or a plugin tree
whose carrier markers cannot be read, grants no licence, and the reason is recorded. The state.db is the cell's
sqlite backup copy, opened read-only.
