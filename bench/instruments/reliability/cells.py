"""The R1 cell registry: JSON-serialisable cells, glob selection and axis validation.

Tight tuning is the #553 probes' (tests/test_real_turn_loop_acp_override.py) scaled by window/64000, so a
128k cell has the same compaction cadence as the proven 64k probes. ``long-*`` cells use LCM's default
tuning with provider-reported usage, as that file's LONG cells do.
